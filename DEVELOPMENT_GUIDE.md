## MongoDB Connection üóÑÔ∏è

The current MongoDB connection issue is related to authentication. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Update MongoDB Atlas Password

The error "bad auth: authentication failed" suggests that either:
1. The password "ezlifedb" is incorrect
2. The user permissions are not set correctly in MongoDB Atlas

Steps to fix:
1. Log into MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Go to Database Access ‚Üí Edit the ezlifedb user ‚Üí Reset Password
3. Update the .env file with the new password:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://ezlifedb:your_new_password@ezlife.tyhljcz.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=EZLife
```

### Option 2: Use Local MongoDB for Development (Recommended)

We've created a setup script that configures a local MongoDB instance for development:

1. Run the script:
```powershell
./setup_local_dev.ps1
```

This script will:
- Check if MongoDB is installed/running locally
- Update the .env file to use local MongoDB
- Create sample data with task breakdowns
- Start both the backend and frontend

## Task Breakdown Feature Overview üìÖ

The task breakdown feature is already implemented in your code:

1. **Task Creation**:
   - Users can specify days per week and hours per day
   - The AI estimator breaks down tasks into daily chunks 
   - Each chunk includes hours and specific work details

2. **Calendar Visualization**:
   - Task breakdowns are displayed as a calendar
   - Each day shows the date, hours required, and completion status
   - Clicking on a day shows the detailed breakdown for that day

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Users can mark days as completed
   - Progress is calculated and displayed as a percentage
   - A visual progress bar shows overall task completion

## Testing the Features üß™

You can run the test script to verify everything is working:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Leon\Desktop\EZlife\backend
python test_task_calendar.py
```

This will:
1. Log in to get an authentication token
2. Create a task with days_per_week and hours_per_day values
3. Check if the AI generates a proper breakdown
4. Update the breakdown by marking a day as completed
5. Verify the progress updates correctly

## UI Appearance üé®

Your TaskPage.jsx and TaskPage.css files already have good styling for the calendar view. The calendar days show:

- Day of week
- Day of month
- Hours required
- Completion status (with a checkmark)

When a day is clicked, it displays:
- The day's summary
- Time required
- A checkbox to mark it complete

## Next Steps üöÄ

1. Fix the MongoDB connection (use one of the options above)
2. Test the task breakdown feature end-to-end
3. Consider adding more visual enhancements like:
   - Color coding days based on workload intensity
   - Sorting options for the task list
   - Filters for viewing tasks by days of the week

With these changes, your EZLife application will provide an excellent task management experience with powerful breakdown and visualization features.
